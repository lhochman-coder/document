DX: s/p LCVA 
You are working with a 65 year old elderly female in the outpatient setting who has suffered a (L) CVA.  The patient is cooperative but complains of left shoulder pain.  Prior to treatment vital signs were:  Blood pressure 150/90, Heart rate: 79, Respiratory rate:  22.  You started the treatment with a hot pack to the left shoulder for 10 minutes with patient in a seated position with 4 layers.  You then performed active assistive range of motion to the patient’s left upper extremity.  The exercises performed were: shoulder forward flexion and abduction, and elbow flexion and extension.  Active assistive exercises to the lower extremities included:  hip flexion and abduction, knee extension and ankle plantar and dorsiflexion.  You performed three sets of ten repetitions of all of the above.  The patient then performed two sets of 10 repetitions of resisted range of motion, using a two pound weight, to the right lower extremity for hip flexion and knee extension.  Finally, you provided stretching to the patient’s tight ankle plantar flexors. You provided the stretch 2 times for each side holding each stretch for 30 seconds. The patient did not offer any remarks about discomfort during the treatment and showed improvement in active motion of the left shoulder and hip. The patient also showed improved range of motion in ankle dorsiflexion with the stretching. You will continue with therapeutic exercises, with a plan to start transfer and gait training next session. You will treat the patient five times per week for thirty-minute sessions.
